# Python Keywords

Python keywords are words that are reseeved for defining the syntax and structures of Python language. They can't be used in naming any entities like variables, classes and functions.

Keywords in Python is case sensitive. So they are to be written as it is. Here is a list of all keywords in python programming.

## List of All Python Keywords

- and - Logical operator
- as - Alias
- assert - For debugging
- break - Break out of Python loops
- class - Used for defining Classes in Python
- continue - Keyword used to continue with the Python loop by skipping the existing
- def - Keyword used for defining a function
- del - Used for deleting objects in Python
- elif - Part of the if-elif-else conditional statement in Python
- else - Part of the if-elif-else conditional statement in Python
- except - A Python keyword used to catch exceptions
- FALSE - Boolean value
- finally - This keyword is used to run a code snippet when no exceptions occur
- for - Define a Python for loop
- from - Used when you need to import only a specific section of a module
- global - Specify a variable scope as global
- if - Used for defining an “if” condition
- import - Python keyword used to import modules
- in - Checks if specified values are present in an iterable object
- is - This keyword is used to test for equality.
- lambda - Create anonymous functions
- None - The None keyword represents a Null value in PYthon
- nonlocal - Declare a variable with non-local scope
- not - Logical operator to negate a condition
- or - A logical operator used when either one of the conditions needs to be true
- pass - This Python keyword passes and lets the function continue further
- raise - Raises an exception when called with the specified value
- return - Exits a running function and returns the value specified
- TRUE - Boolean value
- try - Part of the try…except statement
- while - Used for defining a Python while loop
- with - Creates a block to make exception handling and file operations easy
- yield - Ends a function and returns a generator object

## What are Python Identifiers?

Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.

## What is a Variable in Python?

A variable, is something whose value is changeable over time. It is a memory location where a value can be stored.
In simple words, a variable is like a box where we can put different things inside. We can change what's in the box whenever we want. In order to do this, we need to give a nickname to that box so that we can refer to it. That nickname is called an identifier.

## Rules for Writing Identifiers

There are some rules for writing Identifiers.

Python is case sensitive E.g Name and name are two different identifiers in python.

Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits or an underscore(\_). E.g are myVariable, variable_1, variable_for_print all.

An Identifier cannot start with digit e.g 1variable is not valid.

We can’t use special symbols like !,#,@,%,$ etc in our Identifier.

Identifier can be of any length.

### The following are some naming conventions that are not mandatory but rather good practices to follow.

Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.

Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates the identifier is private.

If the identifier starts and ends with two underscores, than means the identifier is language-defined special name.

While c = 10 is valid, writing count = 10 would make more sense and it would be easier to figure out what it does even when you look at your code after a long time.

Multiple words can be separated using an underscore, for example this_is_a_variable.
