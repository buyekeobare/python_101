# Python Data Types

Python data types are used to define the type of a variable.

- Numeric data types: int, float, complex
- String data types: str
- Sequence types: list, tuple, range
- Binary types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- Mapping data type: dict
- Boolean type: bool
- Set data types: set, frozenset
- Python Numeric Data Type

### Python numeric data type is used to hold numeric values like;

- int - holds signed integers of non-limited length.
- long- holds long integers(exists in Python 2.x, deprecated in Python 3.x).
- float- holds floating precision numbers and itâ€™s accurate up to 15 decimal places.
- complex- holds complex numbers.

In Python, we need not declare a datatype while declaring a variable like C or C++. We can simply just assign values in a variable. But if we want to see what type of numerical value is it holding right now, we can use type() like this

## Python String Data Type

The string is a sequence of characters.
Strings are represented by either single or double-quotes.

## Python List Data Type

The list is a versatile data type exclusive in Python. It is the same as the array in C/C++.
The list in Python can simultaneously hold different types of data.
It is described as an ordered sequence of some data written using square brackets([]) and commas(,).

## Python Tuple

The tuple is another data type which is a sequence of data similar to a list.
It is immutable. What deos this mean? Data in a tuple is write-protected.
Data in a tuple is written using parenthesis and commas.

## Python Dictionary

Python Dictionary is an unordered sequence of data of key-value pair form.
Dictionaries are written within curly braces in the form key:value.
It is very useful to retrieve data in an optimized way among a large amount of data.
